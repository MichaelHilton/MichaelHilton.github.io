I am an associate teaching professor with the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/), in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)


I am the director for the [Software Engieering Minor](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/undergrad/se-minor/index.html) and the [Software Engineering Concentration](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/education/undergrad/swe-concen/index.html).  We are accepting new applications, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

I teach software engineering focused classes.  For more information about my teaching, see the classes I have taught and am teaching [here](teaching).

My research is focused making the world better for developers.  Currently one area of interest for me is investigating flaky tests.
